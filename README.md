# REDIS TRAINING on JATIS MOBILE

## HOW TO USE

To use this app, simply take the file [postman_collection](postman_collection.json) and import that to your postman app. <br>
You don't need to run this app entirely by yourself because I already deployed it. <br>
Just use this host: https://redis-training.jatis.trusty.my.id/ in your postman

## THINGS TO REMEMBER
All the routes are auth protected unless the login and register routes. The authentication method used is bearer. So, everytime you use this API, you must set your auth bearer token in order to get the resources you need.
